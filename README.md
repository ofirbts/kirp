# KIRP – Knowledge-Integrated Reasoning Platform

KIRP is a modular AI system that combines short-term memory, long-term vector-based knowledge,
and intent-aware reasoning to produce reliable, explainable answers.

## Core Features
- Intent classification (store vs query)
- Short-term memory (Redis)
- Long-term knowledge (FAISS vector store)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Modular Agent architecture
- Dockerized local environment

## Architecture
- FastAPI backend
- LangChain + OpenAI
- FAISS persistent vector store
- Redis for session memory
- Streamlit dashboard

## Memory Layers
- **Redis** – session-based, UI-facing memory
- **FAISS** – persistent semantic knowledge

## Run Locally
```bash
docker-compose up --build
